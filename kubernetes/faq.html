		<h4 id="4">Registration Details</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>This is a free event. Registration includes access to (1) the Kubernetes 1.0 Product Launch, which entails a full day of sessions and product demos, and (2) admission to the After Hours Party. We will be providing complimentary refreshments and light snacks throughout the day, and food and drinks at the After Hours Party.</li>

			<li>You may register for both the Kubernetes 1.0 Launch and the After Hours Party or either seperately. Registration and a wristband (pick up during morning check-in) are required for the After Hours Party. Space is limited.</li>

			<li>Onsite registration will be available as space allows. We recommend registering early as space is limited.</li>

			<li>Transportation to and from the After Hours Party will be provided by Kubernetes. We will have buses picking up from the Oregon Convention Center beginning at 6:30 pm. The buses will be doing a continuous drop off and pick up loop until 11:30pm, between the event venue and the Oregon Convention Center. In addition to this route, starting at 10:00 pm, we will have a bus route transporting from the Brewery to the Marriott City Center at 550 SW Oak Street for those attendees staying in hotels on the West side of the river.</li>

			<li>We suggest that those staying on the West side of the city utilize the <a href="http://trimet.org/"target="_blank">Trimet MAX Lightrail</a> for rides to the Oregon Convention Centre, where you will then be picked up via the Kubernetes bus transportation.

			<li><strong>Wristbands:</strong> Wristbands are required for entrance to the After Hours Party. Each person who has registered for the Kubernetes 1.0 Launch After Hours Party will receive a wristband during morning check-in, at the entrance to the Launch, for access to the After Hours party. Attendees must have the wristband on at all times.</li>

			<li><strong>Meals:</strong> Attendees are invited to join us for light snacks and refreshments throughout the day, and complimentary drinks and dinner at the After Hours Party.</li>

			<li><strong>After Hours Party:</strong> This is a party you don't want to miss! Attendees are invited to enjoy food, drinks, music, games and more throughout the evening of July 21 at Rogue Brewery's Green Dragon. The wristband is required for entrance. Space is limited so be sure to register early.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>While at Kubernetes events or related social networking opportunities, attendees should not engage in discriminatory or offensive speech or actions regarding gender, sexuality, race, or religion. Speakers should be especially aware of these concerns.</p>
